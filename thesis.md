Here's where I showcase the different parts of my thesis

---
#### Previous Simulation Results - Tableau
Initially I developed a simulation experiment that used average ERP waveforms as the population dataset.

---
#### Visualizing the Experimental Methodology - R
Following some feedback I went back to the drawing board to develop a new simulation methodology that would use a population dataset containing single trials.

---
#### Simulation Code - Matlab
I then started to focus on the building the simulation code in Matlab that will be used to generate the results of the experiment.

- [Stimulus-Locked ERP Simulation Code](https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-24-Stimulus-Locked-Average-ERP/)


---
At this point in time I'm testing whether the simulation code works properly.

#### Analysis/Visualization Code - R

In "simulation procedures v3.0 & v3.1", I was loading thousands of csv files into R to generate the visualizations and analysis.

- [Simulation Procedure v3.0](https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-25-New-Simulation-Procedure-v3.0/)
- [Simulation Procedure v3.1](https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-26-New-Simulation-Procedure-v3.1/)

---
In "simulation procedure v4.0", I merged all csv files into one large csv file using the command prompt: *copy *.csv merged.csv*. When loaded into R, this merged.csv file is ~ 96 million rows.


- [Simulation Procedure v4.0](https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-28-New-Simulation-Procedure-v4.0/)

---
In "simulation procedure v5.0", I'm going to attempt to reduce the size of the *merged.csv* file so that I can speed up the analysis.
