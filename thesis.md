Here's where I showcase the different parts of my thesis

---
#### Tableau - Previous Simulation Results
Initially I developed a simulation experiment that used average ERP waveforms as the population dataset.

---
#### R - Visualizing the Experimental Methodology
Following some feedback I went back to the drawing board to develop a new simulation methodology that would use a population dataset containing single trials.

- [Methodology Visualization]("https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-20-Methodology-Visualization/")

---
#### Matlab - Simulation Code
I then started to focus on the building the simulation code in Matlab that will be used to generate the results of the experiment.

- PLACEHOLDER FOR MATLAB CODE

At this point in time I'm testing whether the simulation code works properly.

#### R - Analysis/Visualization Code
- [Simulation Procedure](https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-21-new-simulation-procedure/)
