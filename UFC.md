This is where I post about the work I've done analyzing UFC data!

#### Pulling UFC Data

The first step in the process is to gather the UFC data: [Webscraping UFC Data](https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-21-1-UFC-Webscraper-Report/).

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

I decided to test out the "highcharter" package in R too see if it would be feasible to make some nice interactive visuals with the UFC data: [UFC visuals](https://richard-j-obrien.github.io/2020-03-24-Interactive-Highcharter/). While highcharter is a great package, it didn't seem feasible to spend that much time generating all the visuals I wanted.

  Using Tableau I used the first webscraper's data to generate visuals that compare weightclasses career statistics.

  With the second webscraper's data I generated visuals to compare individuals performance.
