---
Currently I'm a Data Analyst working for the BC Pension Corporation. Previously, I worked for the BC Government in the Labour Market Information Office as a Data Analyst.

Master's student at the University of Waterloo studying Neuroscience. My thesis revolves around quantifying the specificity and sensitivity (i.e., type-I & II error rates and power) of several event related potential peak-picking and averaging methodologies. My work aims to determine whether any of these methodologies outperforms the others and provides a more accurate way to quantify event related potential waveforms.
