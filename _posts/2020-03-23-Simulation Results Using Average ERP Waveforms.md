title: Simulation Results Using Average ERP Waveforms
subtitle: Thesis - Design Option 1
---


#### Design Option 1

The experimental design and results revolve around using a population dataset that contains average ERP waveforms.

Step 1: Build 2 population datasets;
1) by calculating the average ERP waveform using the stimulus-locked methodology
2) by calculating the average ERP waveform using the RIDE methodology

Step 2: Create a control and experimental condition by using the sample size to randomly sample without replacement average ERP waveforms from the population dataset

Step 3: Apply the effect size to the experimental condition

Step 4: Calculate the P3 amplitudes of each average ERP waveform in each condition using one of the peak-picking methodologies

Step 5: Calculate an ANOVA to determine whether a statistically significant difference is present between the control and experimental conditions P3 amplitudes

Step 6: Calculate the power, type-I error rate, P3 means and sds
